- `SubRip/SRT` - Standard SRT format
- `S_TEXT/3GPP` - 3GPP Timed Text (MP4)
- `S_TEXT/ASS` - Advanced SubStation Alpha

### OCR Conversion
- `S_HDMV/PGS` - Blu-ray PGS subtitles (converted via OCR)

## üéØ Smart Track Recommendation

SrtExtractor features an intelligent recommendation engine that automatically selects the best subtitle track based on your preferences and available options:

### **Priority Order**
1. **SubRip/SRT Tracks** (Highest Priority) - Direct text extraction, no OCR required
2. **Other Text-based Tracks** (ASS, SSA, VTT) - Also direct extraction
3. **HDMV PGS Tracks** (Lower Priority) - Requires OCR conversion

### **Smart Selection Logic**
- **When both SubRip/SRT and HDMV PGS are available**: SubRip/SRT is automatically recommended
- **Quality-based selection**: Within each priority group, tracks are ranked by bitrate and frame count
- **User preferences respected**: Forced subtitles and closed captions are prioritized based on settings
- **Comprehensive logging**: Track selection decisions are logged for transparency

### **Example Scenarios**
- **File with SubRip/SRT + HDMV PGS**: SubRip/SRT track recommended (faster extraction, no OCR)
- **File with only HDMV PGS**: HDMV PGS track recommended (with OCR processing)
- **Multiple SubRip/SRT tracks**: Highest quality SubRip/SRT track recommended

## üß† Smart OCR Correction

SrtExtractor includes an intelligent OCR correction system that automatically fixes common errors:

### Automatic Fixes
- **Extra Spaces**: `T he` ‚Üí `The`, `sh it` ‚Üí `shit`
- **Missing Spaces**: `Yougotanybiscuits` ‚Üí `You got any biscuits`
- **Character Substitutions**: `RipIey` ‚Üí `Ripley`, `feeIdead` ‚Üí `feel dead`
- **Apostrophe Issues**: `you)re` ‚Üí `you're`, `won)t` ‚Üí `won't`
- **Contractions**: `I am` ‚Üí `I'm`, `you are` ‚Üí `you're`
- **Common Phrases**: `Whatyoudoing` ‚Üí `What you doing`

### Correction Patterns
The system uses regex-based patterns to identify and fix over 100 common OCR errors, ensuring your subtitles are clean and professional.

### üöÄ Multi-Pass Correction System

SrtExtractor now features an advanced multi-pass correction system that significantly improves subtitle quality:

#### Why Multi-Pass?
OCR errors often come in different types that require multiple passes to catch:
- **First Pass**: Catches obvious spacing and character issues
- **Second Pass**: Identifies missed contractions and phrase corrections
- **Third Pass**: Finds subtle character substitutions and remaining errors

#### Correction Modes
- **Quick Mode**: 1 pass (fastest, catches obvious errors)
- **Standard Mode**: 3 passes with smart convergence (recommended)
- **Thorough Mode**: 5 passes without convergence (maximum quality)

#### Smart Convergence
The system automatically detects when no more corrections are needed and stops early, saving processing time while ensuring quality.

#### Real-World Results
Multi-pass correction has been proven to find **additional corrections** on subsequent passes:
- **Example**: Blade (1998) subtitle file showed improvements across multiple correction runs
- **Typical Results**: Each pass finds 5-15% additional corrections missed by previous passes
- **Quality Improvement**: Significantly cleaner, more professional subtitle output

### Batch Correction Results
The correction system is incredibly effective when processing large collections:
- **Average**: 1000+ corrections per SRT file
- **Large Collections**: 80,000+ total corrections across 79 files
- **Processing Speed**: Hundreds of files processed in minutes
- **Quality Improvement**: Professional-grade subtitle formatting

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Tools Not Found**: Use "Re-detect Tools" button or check tool installation
2. **Extraction Fails**: Verify the selected track is a supported format
3. **OCR Issues**: Ensure Subtitle Edit CLI is properly built and available
4. **Batch Mode Not Working**: Switch to the Batch tab and add files to the queue via drag & drop
5. **Network Files Slow**: Files on network drives will take longer - this is normal
6. **Temporary Files Left Behind**: Use the "üßπ Cleanup Temp Files" button if needed
7. **Cancellation Issues**: If processes don't stop, restart the application
8. **Batch SRT Correction Shows "None Found"**: Ensure you've selected a folder and clicked "Scan for SRT Files"
9. **SRT Files Not Updating**: Check that files aren't read-only or locked by another application
10. **Wrong Track Recommended**: Check the log for recommendation decisions; you can manually select a different track
