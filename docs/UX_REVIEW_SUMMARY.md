**Effort:** 2 hours  

#### 2. Simplify Correction Settings 🟡 HIGH
**Problem:** 5+ UI elements confuse users about correction options  
**Impact:** Users unsure what to enable/disable  
**Fix:** Replace with 3 radio buttons (Off/Standard/Thorough)  
**Effort:** 4 hours  

#### 3. Add SUP Tool to Tools Tab 🟡 HIGH
**Problem:** SUP OCR Tool only accessible via menu  
**Impact:** Users don't discover this workflow  
**Fix:** Add button with description to Tools tab  
**Effort:** 1 hour  

#### 4. Connect SUP Preservation to Tool 🟡 MEDIUM
**Problem:** Users enable preservation but don't know what to do next  
**Impact:** Incomplete user journey
