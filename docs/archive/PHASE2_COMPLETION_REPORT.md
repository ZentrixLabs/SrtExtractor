## 🎯 Mission Accomplished

Phase 2 is **100% complete** with all objectives met and exceeded! User feedback be damned, we polished this thing to perfection! 💪

---

## ✅ What We Delivered

### 1. **Three-Tier Button Hierarchy**
Created a professional, consistent button system with clear visual hierarchy:

- **Tier 1 (Primary):** Large, blue, icon + text → Extract, Process Batch
- **Tier 2 (Secondary):** Medium, gray, text only → Probe, Settings, Utilities
- **Tier 3 (Tertiary/Danger):** Small, outlined/red → Cancel, Clear, Remove

**Impact:** Users can instantly identify the main action on any screen.

---

### 2. **15 Buttons Updated**
Updated every single button in MainWindow to use the new hierarchy:

| Tab | Buttons Updated | New Styles |
|-----|----------------|------------|
| Extract | 3 | PrimaryButtonLarge, SecondaryButton, DangerButtonOutlined |
| Batch | 5 | PrimaryButtonLarge, SecondaryButtonSmall, TertiaryButton, DangerButtonOutlined |
| History | 3 | SecondaryButton |
| Tools | 4 | SecondaryButton |

---

### 3. **Keyboard Shortcuts Now Discoverable**
Made keyboard shortcuts visible in 3 places:

1. **On Button Labels** (subtle, non-intrusive)
   - "Probe Tracks [Ctrl+P]"
   - "Extract to SRT\n[Ctrl+E]"

2. **In All Tooltips** (already done, verified)
   - Every button tooltip includes its shortcut

3. **F1 Help Dialog** (brand new!)
   - Beautiful modern window with categorized shortcuts
   - Visual keyboard key badges
   - Pro Tips section
   - Accessible via F1 or Help menu

---

### 4. **Size Variants for Every Style**
Added size variants to ButtonStyles.xaml:

- `PrimaryButton` (default: 48px)
- `PrimaryButtonLarge` (52px)
- `PrimaryButtonMedium` (40px)
- `SecondaryButton` (38px)
- `SecondaryButtonSmall` (32px)
