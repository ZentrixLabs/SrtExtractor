# Bug Fix: Settings Button in Toast Notification

**Date:** October 9, 2025  
**Issue:** "Open Settings" button in missing tools notification doesn't work  
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## Problem

When the app detected missing tools, it showed a toast notification asking "Would you like to open Settings?". Clicking "Yes" did nothing because it was setting a flag (`ShowSettingsOnStartup`) that only gets checked during window load.

---

## Solution

**Simple Event-Based Approach:**

1. ✅ Added `RequestOpenSettings` event to `ExtractionState`
2. ✅ Wired event to existing `SettingsMenuItem_Click` handler
3. ✅ Trigger event when user clicks "Yes" in notification

---

## Implementation

### Files Modified (3)

**1. ExtractionState.cs** - Added event
```csharp
// Event to request opening settings dialog from toast notifications
public event EventHandler? RequestOpenSettings;

public void TriggerOpenSettings()
{
    RequestOpenSettings?.Invoke(this, EventArgs.Empty);
}
```

**2. MainViewModel.cs** - Trigger event instead of setting flag
```csharp
if (result)
{
    // Trigger the event to open settings immediately
    State.TriggerOpenSettings();
}
```

**3. MainWindow.xaml.cs** - Wire event to existing handler
```csharp
// Subscribe to settings request event
viewModel.State.RequestOpenSettings += (s, e) => SettingsMenuItem_Click(this, new RoutedEventArgs());
```

---

## How It Works

```
User clicks "Yes" in toast
    ↓
MainViewModel calls State.TriggerOpenSettings()
    ↓
Event fires RequestOpenSettings
    ↓
MainWindow receives event
    ↓
Calls existing SettingsMenuItem_Click()
    ↓
Settings window opens ✅
```

## Lines of Code

**Total:** ~10 lines (vs. ~50 lines in overcomplicated version)
- Event declaration: 1 line
- Event trigger method: 4 lines  
- Event subscription: 1 line
- Event handler invocation: 1 line
- Cleanup: 3 lines removed

---

## Testing

```
✅ Click "Yes" in missing tools notification → Settings opens
✅ Settings menu item still works normally
✅ No compilation errors
✅ No runtime errors
```

---

## Status

✅ **FIXED** - Settings button now works correctly  
✅ **SIMPLE** - Reuses existing code  
✅ **CLEAN** - Minimal changes  

**The settings button in the missing tools toast notification now works as expected!**
