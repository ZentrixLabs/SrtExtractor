## 🎯 Objective

Add comprehensive, helpful tooltips to every interactive element in the MainWindow to provide inline help and improve discoverability of features and keyboard shortcuts.

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **File Selection Controls**
- ✅ "Pick Video..." button with keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+O)
- ✅ File path TextBox with right-click hint
- ✅ Context menu tooltips (already existed)

### 2. **Settings Controls**
- ✅ Batch Mode checkbox with detailed explanation
- ✅ "Prefer Forced Subtitles" radio button with use case
- ✅ "Prefer CC" radio button with use case

### 5. **Data Display Controls**

- ✅ Log TextBox with context menu and file location info

## 📝 Tooltip Format Used

All tooltips follow a consistent pattern:

```xaml
ToolTip="Primary explanation&#x0a;Additional details&#x0a;Keyboard Shortcut: Ctrl+X"
```

Where `&#x0a;` creates newlines for multi-line tooltips.

### Example - Extract Button:
```
Extract the selected subtitle track and convert to SRT format
Text subtitles are extracted instantly
Image subtitles (PGS) require OCR processing (slower)
Multi-pass correction is automatically applied
Keyboard Shortcut: Ctrl+E
```

## 🎨 Tooltip Content Strategy

Each tooltip provides:
1. **What it does** - Clear action description
2. **Additional context** - Helpful details about behavior
3. **Keyboard shortcut** - When applicable
4. **Technical info** - File paths, variables, or settings details
5. **Right-click hints** - For controls with context menus

## 📊 Statistics

- **Total controls enhanced:** 18
- **Buttons with tooltips:** 12
- **Form controls with tooltips:** 6
- **Average tooltip lines:** 2-4 lines
- **Keyboard shortcuts mentioned:** 8

## 🚀 Impact
