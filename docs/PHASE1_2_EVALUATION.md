# Phase 1.2 Evaluation - Make Mode Selection Obvious

**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Status:** MOSTLY COMPLETE (via tab implementation)  
**Remaining Work:** Minimal cleanup

---

## üìä Evaluation Summary

Phase 1.2 aimed to **eliminate dual-mode confusion** by removing the hard-to-find "Enable Batch Mode" checkbox. With the new tab-based interface, **this issue is already 90% solved**!

### ‚úÖ Already Fixed by Tab Interface

| Problem | Status | Solution |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Users don't realize there are two modes | ‚úÖ **FIXED** | Tabs make it obvious (Extract vs Batch) |
| Elements appear/disappear based on checkbox | ‚úÖ **FIXED** | No visibility toggling in UI |
| Checkbox is easy to miss | ‚úÖ **FIXED** | No checkbox in main UI |
| Mode is not obvious | ‚úÖ **FIXED** | Active tab clearly shows current workflow |

---

## üîç What's Still in the Code

### Dead Code (No Longer Used in UI)

These properties exist but are **NOT referenced** in the new tab-based MainWindow.xaml:

**In `ExtractionState.cs`:**
```csharp
// Lines 86-91 - Dead code
private bool _isBatchMode;  // ‚ùå Not used in UI
private double _queueColumnWidth = 0;  // ‚ùå Not used in UI

// Lines 307-309 - Dead code
public bool ShowBatchMode => IsBatchMode;  // ‚ùå Not bound to anything
public bool ShowSingleFileMode => !IsBatchMode;  // ‚ùå Not bound to anything

// Lines 173-183 - Dead handler
partial void OnIsBatchModeChanged(bool value)
{
    WindowTitle = value ? "SrtExtractor - Batch Mode" : "SrtExtractor - MKV/MP4 Subtitle Extractor";
    OnPropertyChanged(nameof(ShowBatchMode));
    OnPropertyChanged(nameof(ShowSingleFileMode));
}
```

### Still Referenced (Needs Cleanup)

**In `SettingsWindow.xaml` (Lines 333-335):**
```xaml
<!-- ‚ö†Ô∏è OBSOLETE: This checkbox doesn't make sense with tab interface -->
<CheckBox Content="Enable batch mode by default" 
          IsChecked="{Binding State.IsBatchMode}"
          Margin="0,5"/>
```

**In Menu (MainWindow.xaml - removed but was at line 176-180):**
- Already removed the "Toggle Batch Mode" menu item ‚úÖ

## üìã Remaining Cleanup Tasks

### Option 1: Complete Removal (Recommended)

**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes  
**Impact:** Cleaner codebase, less confusion

#### Tasks:
1. ‚úÖ **Remove from SettingsWindow.xaml** (5 min)
   - Delete "Enable batch mode by default" checkbox (lines 330-341)
   - It doesn't make sense with tabs - users just click the tab

2. **Remove from ExtractionState.cs** (10 min)
   - Delete `IsBatchMode` property (lines 86-88)
   - Delete `QueueColumnWidth` property (lines 90-91)
   - Delete `ShowBatchMode` computed property (line 307)
   - Delete `ShowSingleFileMode` computed property (line 309)
   - Delete `OnIsBatchModeChanged` handler (lines 173-183)

3. **Remove from MainViewModel.cs** (15 min)
   - Search for any remaining `IsBatchMode` references
   - Remove `OnBatchModeChanged` method if exists (lines 1703-1747)
   - Update `ToggleBatchMode` to just switch tabs (already done ‚úÖ)

### Option 2: Minimal Cleanup (Fastest)

**Estimated Time:** 10 minutes  
**Impact:** Good enough, leaves harmless dead code

#### Tasks:
1. **Just remove from SettingsWindow.xaml** (5 min)
   - Delete the batch mode checkbox
   - Add comment explaining it's tab-based now

2. **Add deprecation comments** (5 min)
   - Mark IsBatchMode as obsolete in ExtractionState
   - Leave the code for backward compatibility

---

## üí° Recommendation

**Go with Option 1 (Complete Removal)** because:

‚úÖ **The properties are truly dead code** - not used in UI  
‚úÖ **Window title no longer needs mode indication** - tab shows current context  
‚úÖ **Cleaner codebase** - easier to maintain  
‚úÖ **No user impact** - nothing visible is being removed  
‚úÖ **Prevents confusion** - developers won't wonder what IsBatchMode does  

The only "risk" is if there's external code referencing these properties, but since this is a WPF desktop app (not a library), that's unlikely.

## üéØ Updated Assessment

### Phase 1.2 Status: **90% COMPLETE**

| Task | Original Estimate | Status |
|------|-------------------|--------|
| Remove IsBatchMode property | 1 hour | ‚è≥ Pending (5 min) |
| Remove mode-switching logic | 1 hour | ‚úÖ Done (tabs handle it) |
| Remove visibility converters | 30 min | ‚úÖ Done (not in XAML) |
| Update Settings to remove checkbox | 30 min | ‚è≥ Pending (5 min) |
| Add tooltip to Batch tab | 15 min | ‚úÖ Done (instructions in tab) |

**Total Remaining:** ~15 minutes of cleanup work

---

## üöÄ Decision

**Should we complete Phase 1.2 cleanup?**

**YES** - It's quick and makes the codebase cleaner. Here's what I recommend:

1. Remove the batch mode checkbox from SettingsWindow.xaml (it's confusing with tabs)
2. Remove the dead IsBatchMode-related properties from ExtractionState
3. Update window title logic to be simpler
4. Test that everything still works

This will take about 15-30 minutes total and complete Phase 1.2 entirely.

**Do you want me to proceed with the complete cleanup?** Or would you prefer to keep the dead code for now and move on to Phase 1.3 (Humanize Track Information)?
