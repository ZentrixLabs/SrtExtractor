## 🔍 Detailed Analysis: SUP Loading Feature

### Current Implementation

**Access Path:** Tools Menu → Load SUP File...  
**Opens:** Dedicated `SupOcrWindow` with its own ViewModel  
**Purpose:** Process SUP files directly without MKV extraction

### Strengths ✅

1. **Clean, Focused UI**: The SUP OCR window is well-designed
   - Clear sections: Input File, OCR Settings, Processing Status, Log
   - Appropriate visual hierarchy
   - Good use of groupboxes for organization

2. **Comprehensive Settings**:
   - Language selection dropdown (eng, fra, deu, spa, ita)
   - OCR correction toggle with clear explanation
   - Progress tracking with determinate/indeterminate states

3. **Good Feedback**:
   - Timestamped processing log
   - Real-time status messages
   - Success notifications with output path

4. **Proper State Management**:
   - Disable/enable controls based on processing state
   - Cancel button appears during processing
   - CanStartOcr validation prevents invalid operations

### Issues & Opportunities 🎯

#### 1. **Discoverability Issue** ⭐⭐⭐ CRITICAL
**Problem:** SUP OCR Tool is hidden in Tools menu  
**Impact:** Users who extract PGS subtitles don't know they can re-process SUP files

**User Journey Gap:**
```
User extracts PGS → Gets SUP file → Wants to re-OCR with different settings
   ↓
   Where do I go? 🤔
   - Not obvious from Extract tab
   - Not mentioned in completion message
   - Tools menu not intuitive location
```

**Recommendations:**
- [ ] Add "Re-OCR SUP File..." button to Extract tab success message
- [ ] Show SUP tool hint when SUP preservation is enabled
- [ ] Add context menu on SUP files: "Open with SUP OCR Tool"
- [ ] Consider adding SUP processing directly to Extract tab workflow

#### 2. **Inconsistent Settings** ⭐⭐ HIGH
**Problem:** SUP OCR Window has duplicate settings from main app

**Duplication:**
- SUP OCR Window: Language dropdown (5 languages hardcoded)
- Main Settings: OCR Language text field (any language code)
- SUP OCR Window: Apply Correction checkbox
- Main Settings: Enable SRT Correction + Multi-Pass settings

**Recommendations:**
- [ ] **Option A (Recommended):** Inherit settings from main app
  ```
  SupOcrViewModel should read from State:
  - _ocrLanguage = State.OcrLanguage
  - _applyCorrection = State.EnableSrtCorrection
  ```
- [ ] **Option B:** Add "Use App Defaults" checkbox
- [ ] **Option C:** Show current app settings above the overrides

#### 3. **Workflow Separation** ⭐⭐ MEDIUM
**Problem:** SUP OCR Window feels disconnected from main workflow

**Issues:**
- Separate window = different mental model
- Can't see main app settings while using SUP tool
- No way to queue multiple SUP files
- Output location not customizable

**Recommendations:**
- [ ] Add SUP file support to Batch tab (drag & drop .sup files)
- [ ] Show app-wide settings summary in SUP window header
- [ ] Add "Open in Explorer" button after successful OCR
- [ ] Consider modal dialog instead of separate window for better integration

#### 4. **Limited Language Options** ⭐ LOW
**Problem:** Only 5 languages hardcoded in ComboBox

```xaml
<ComboBoxItem Content="eng" IsSelected="True"/>
<ComboBoxItem Content="fra"/>
<ComboBoxItem Content="deu"/>
<ComboBoxItem Content="spa"/>
<ComboBoxItem Content="ita"/>
```

**Issue:** Main app supports any tessdata language, but SUP window doesn't

**Recommendations:**
- [ ] Dynamically populate from available tessdata files
- [ ] Allow text input like main settings (more flexible)
- [ ] Show "(Current: eng)" in dropdown to indicate active setting

#### 5. **Settings Preservation Confusion** ⭐⭐ MEDIUM
**Problem:** Connection between SUP preservation setting and SUP tool unclear

**User Mental Model Gap:**
```
Settings → "Preserve SUP files for debugging" ✓
   ↓
User extracts PGS subtitles → Gets .sup file
   ↓
Now what? How do I use this SUP file? 🤔
```

**Current Flow:**
1. Enable "Preserve SUP files" in Settings
2. Extract PGS subtitles → .sup file created
3. User must discover Tools → Load SUP File on their own

**Recommendations:**
- [ ] When SUP preservation enabled, show tooltip: "Use Tools → Load SUP File to re-process"
- [ ] Add link in settings explanation: "Preserve SUP files (Load SUP Tool →)"
- [ ] Auto-show SUP tool after extraction if setting enabled
- [ ] Add "Open in SUP OCR Tool" to file context menu

#### 6. **Progress Feedback Inconsistency** ⭐ LOW
**Problem:** Different progress indicators between main app and SUP window

**Main App Extract Tab:**
- Stage text ("Extracting PGS subtitles...")
- Progress bar with percentage
- Detailed progress text ("Processing frame 650/1000")
- Time estimates

**SUP OCR Window:**
- Status message only
- Indeterminate progress bar (no percentage)
- No time estimates
- Less detailed than main workflow

**Recommendations:**
- [ ] Add frame count progress: "OCR frame 45/373"
- [ ] Show estimated time remaining based on frame count
- [ ] Use consistent progress component from main app
- [ ] Add "Processing speed: ~140ms/frame" for transparency

---

## 🎨 Overall Application UX Review

### Tab Structure (Extract, Batch, History, Tools)

**Assessment: ✅ Excellent** - Clean separation of concerns

**Strengths:**
- Logical grouping by user goal
- No mode confusion (unlike v1.x)
- Keyboard shortcuts well-integrated (Ctrl+B for Batch)
- Each tab focused and uncluttered

**Minor Opportunities:**
- [ ] Add tab icons to improve scannability at a glance
- [ ] Show badge counts (e.g., "Batch (5)" when queue has files)
- [ ] Add "Getting Started" hint on first launch pointing to Extract tab

---

### Settings Organization

**Assessment: ⚠️ Good, but needs consolidation**

**Current Structure:**
```
Settings Window (Options → Settings)
├─ Preferences Tab
│  ├─ Subtitle Type Preference (Forced vs CC)
│  ├─ OCR Language
│  ├─ SRT Correction Toggle
│  ├─ Multi-Pass Correction (4 settings!)
│  └─ Output File Naming
└─ Advanced Tab
   ├─ Batch Processing Note
   └─ Debugging Options (Preserve SUP)
```

**Issues:**
1. **Multi-Pass Correction overwhelming** (5 UI elements in one section)
2. **Preferences tab cramped** - too many concepts in one view
3. **Advanced tab underutilized** - mostly just links to other tabs
4. **SUP preservation buried** in Advanced → Debugging

**Recommendations:**

#### Option A: Reorganize into 3 Focused Tabs ⭐⭐⭐
```
Settings Window
├─ Basic Tab (Most Common)
│  ├─ Subtitle Type Preference
│  ├─ OCR Language
│  ├─ Output File Naming
│  └─ Enable SRT Correction (toggle)
│
├─ OCR & Correction Tab (Advanced)
│  ├─ Multi-Pass Correction Settings (collapsed by default)
│  │  ├─ Enable Multi-Pass ✓
│  │  ├─ Mode: Standard ▼
│  │  ├─ Max Passes: 3
│  │  └─ Smart Convergence ✓
│  └─ SUP Processing
│     ├─ Preserve SUP files for debugging
│     └─ Link to SUP OCR Tool →
│
└─ Advanced Tab
   └─ (Future: Performance, Logging, Experimental features)
```

#### Option B: Use Collapsible Sections (Expanders) ⭐⭐
Keep 2 tabs but use Expanders for advanced settings:
```
Preferences Tab
├─ Subtitle Selection (always visible)
├─ OCR Language (always visible)
├─ Output Naming (always visible)
├─ ▶ SRT Correction (collapsed by default)
│   ├─ Enable correction
│   └─ Multi-pass settings
└─ ▶ Advanced Options (collapsed)
    └─ Preserve SUP files
```

**Recommendation:** Go with Option A - cleaner separation

---

### Correction Settings Complexity

**Assessment: ⚠️ Too much cognitive load for average user**

**Current Settings (5 UI elements):**
1. Enable SRT Correction checkbox
2. Enable Multi-Pass Correction checkbox
3. Mode dropdown (Quick/Standard/Thorough)
4. Max Passes text input
5. Smart Convergence checkbox

**User Confusion Points:**
- "What's the difference between SRT Correction and Multi-Pass Correction?"
- "If I disable Multi-Pass, does correction still happen?"
- "Why do I need to set both Mode AND Max Passes?"
- "Should I use Standard or Thorough?"

**Recommendation: Simplify to 2-Level System** ⭐⭐⭐

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Subtitle Correction                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                         │
│ ○ Off (raw OCR output)                  │
│ ● Standard (recommended) ←              │
│ ○ Thorough (5+ passes, slower)          │
│                                         │
│ ℹ Standard uses smart correction with   │
│   automatic convergence detection       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Behind the scenes:**
- Off = `EnableSrtCorrection: false`
- Standard = `EnableMultiPassCorrection: true, Mode: "Standard", SmartConvergence: true`
- Thorough = `EnableMultiPassCorrection: true, Mode: "Thorough", SmartConvergence: false`

**Power User Option:** Add "Advanced..." button for manual control

---

### Tools Tab Organization

**Assessment: ⚠️ Good structure, minor improvements needed**

**Current Structure:**
```
Tools Tab
├─ Extraction Settings (top)
│  ├─ Subtitle Preference
│  ├─ OCR Language
│  ├─ File Pattern
│  └─ Advanced Settings button
│
├─ Utilities (middle)
│  ├─ SRT Correction
│  ├─ VobSub Track Analyzer
│  └─ Re-detect Tools
│
└─ Tool Status (bottom)
   ├─ MKVToolNix ✓
   ├─ FFmpeg ✓
   └─ (Subtitle Edit removed in v2.0.4)
```

**Issues:**
1. **SUP OCR Tool missing** - Should be in Utilities section
2. **Tool Status unnecessary** - All tools bundled, always available
3. **Re-detect Tools pointless** - No external dependencies
4. **Advanced Settings button** - Creates modal dialog (Settings Window)

**Recommendations:**
- [ ] **Add SUP OCR Tool button** to Utilities section
- [ ] **Remove Tool Status section** - no longer relevant
- [ ] **Remove Re-detect Tools** - all tools bundled
- [ ] **Rename "Utilities" to "Tools"** for clarity
- [ ] **Add "Batch SRT Correction"** to Tools section

**Proposed Structure:**
```
Tools Tab
├─ Quick Settings (top)
│  ├─ Subtitle Preference
│  ├─ OCR Language
│  ├─ Correction Mode (Off/Standard/Thorough)
│  ├─ File Pattern
│  └─ More Settings... button
│
└─ Subtitle Tools (expanded)
   ├─ 🔧 Load SUP File...
   ├─ 📝 SRT Correction (Single File)
   ├─ 📂 Batch SRT Correction
   └─ 🎬 VobSub Track Analyzer
```

---
