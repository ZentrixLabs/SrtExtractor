## ‚è∏Ô∏è What's Deferred to v2.1+

### Phase 2: Major Improvements (Not Required for v2.0)

These are enhancements that would be nice but aren't blocking:

#### 2.1 Better Settings Placement
- **Status**: Not started
- **Reason**: Current settings in Tools tab works well enough
- **Priority for v2.1**: Medium

#### 2.2 Consistent Button Hierarchy
- **Status**: Not started
- **Reason**: Current buttons are functional, could be more polished
- **Priority for v2.1**: Medium

#### 2.3 Keyboard Shortcut Discoverability
- **Status**: Not started (though shortcuts work well)
- **Reason**: Tooltips show shortcuts, welcome screen covers them
- **Priority for v2.1**: Low

#### 2.4 Simplify DataGrid Columns
- **Status**: Already partially done (7 columns vs 10)
- **Reason**: View presets (Simple/Detailed/Technical) not essential
- **Priority for v2.1**: Low

### Phase 3: Polish (Defer to v2.1 or Later)

All Phase 3 items are polish/nice-to-have:
- Menu reorganization
- Enhanced batch queue UI (thumbnails, etc.)
- Improved error states
- Network warning as toast
- Progress indicator consolidation
- Accessibility improvements

**Priority for v2.1**: Low to Medium
