---

## üöÄ Phase 1: Critical Issues (Must Have for v2.0)

These changes have the highest impact on user experience and should be completed before release.

### 1.1 Simplify Main Window Layout ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Effort:** HIGH (3-5 days)  
**Impact:** Reduces cognitive overload by 60%

#### Problem
Main window tries to do everything in one view (1200+ lines of XAML). Users are overwhelmed by options and don't know where to look first.

#### Solution: Tab-Based Interface
Split the monolithic UI into logical sections using a modern tab control.

#### Tasks
- [x] **Create TabControl structure in MainWindow.xaml** (4 hours) ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
  - Tab 1: "Extract" - Single file extraction workflow
  - Tab 2: "Batch" - Batch processing interface  
  - Tab 3: "History" - Recent files and activity log
  - Tab 4: "Tools" - Advanced tools (SRT correction, VobSub analyzer)

- [x] **Refactor "Extract" tab** (6 hours) ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
  - Move file selection to top
  - Track list in center (all columns preserved)
  - Extract button prominent in actions section
  - Settings summary displayed
  - Log removed from this tab (now in History tab)

- [x] **Refactor "Batch" tab** (4 hours) ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
  - Move batch queue to main area (full width)
  - Settings panel at top with instructions
  - Large "Process Batch" button at bottom
  - Progress indicator integrated

- [x] **Create "History" tab** (3 hours) ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
  - Recent files list (last 20 files)
  - Full log viewer with toolbar
  - Export log functionality (Save, Open Folder buttons)

- [x] **Create "Tools" tab** (2 hours) ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
  - SRT Correction launcher
  - VobSub Track Analyzer launcher
  - Re-detect Tools button
  - Extraction settings (preferences, OCR language, file pattern)
  - Advanced Settings button (opens SettingsWindow)
  - Tool status display for all required tools

#### Files to Modify
- `SrtExtractor/Views/MainWindow.xaml` (Lines 109-1193)
- `SrtExtractor/Views/MainWindow.xaml.cs`
- `SrtExtractor/ViewModels/MainViewModel.cs`

#### Implementation Notes
```xaml
<TabControl>
  <TabItem Header="Extract">
    <!-- Simplified single-file UI -->
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem Header="Batch">
    <!-- Batch processing UI -->
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem Header="History">
    <!-- Recent files + full log -->
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem Header="Tools">
    <!-- Advanced tools -->
  </TabItem>
</TabControl>
```

### 1.2 Make Mode Selection Obvious ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Effort:** LOW (4-6 hours)  
**Impact:** Eliminates confusion about dual modes

#### Problem
Users don't realize there are two modes. Elements appear/disappear based on a checkbox that's easy to miss (Line 308).

#### Solution: Remove Mode Toggle Entirely
Replace dual-mode UI with separate tabs (covered in 1.1). This naturally separates single-file from batch operations.

#### Tasks
- [x] **Remove IsBatchMode property** from ExtractionState.cs (1 hour) ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- [x] **Remove mode-switching logic** from MainViewModel.cs (1 hour) ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- [x] **Remove visibility converters** for ShowBatchMode/ShowSingleFileMode (30 min) ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- [x] **Update Settings** to remove "Enable Batch Mode" checkbox (30 min) ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- [x] **Add tooltip to Batch tab** explaining batch mode (15 min) ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

#### Files to Modify
- `SrtExtractor/State/ExtractionState.cs` (Lines 86-169)
- `SrtExtractor/ViewModels/MainViewModel.cs` (Lines 1703-1760)
- `SrtExtractor/Views/MainWindow.xaml` (Lines 308-322, 440-457, 461-485)
- `SrtExtractor/Views/SettingsWindow.xaml` (Lines 331-341)

#### Implementation Notes
- Simplifies state management
- Removes ~200 lines of visibility binding code
- Makes UI predictable

---

### 1.3 Humanize Track Information ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Effort:** MEDIUM (1-2 days)  
**Impact:** Makes track selection obvious to non-technical users

#### Problem
DataGrid shows technical details: "S_HDMV/PGS", "S_TEXT/UTF8", cryptic codec names that mean nothing to users.

#### Solution: Human-Friendly Labels
Replace technical terms with user-friendly descriptions and visual indicators.

#### Tasks
- [x] **Add TrackFormatDisplay computed property** to SubtitleTrack model (2 hours) ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
  - Humanizes: S_HDMV/PGS ‚Üí "Image-based (PGS)"
  - Humanizes: S_TEXT/UTF8 ‚Üí "Text (SRT)"
  - Preserves original Codec property for technical inspection

- [x] **Add SpeedIndicator property** (1 hour) ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

- [x] **Simplify DataGrid columns** (3 hours) ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
  - Removed from default view: ID, Bitrate, Frames, Duration
  - Visible columns: Language, Format, Speed, Type, Forced, Recommended, Name
  - Total: 7 columns (down from 10) - no horizontal scrolling
  - Much clearer for non-technical users

- [x] **Technical details preserved via tooltips** (4 hours) ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
  - Row hover: Shows TechnicalDetails property with all info
  - Context menu: "Show Technical Details" for full dialog
  - Format column tooltip: Shows actual codec string
  - Log output: Shows detailed technical info for each track

- [x] **Update tooltips** to explain columns (1 hour) ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
  - All columns have clear explanatory tooltips
  - Headers explain what information is shown
  - Progressive disclosure approach

#### Files to Modify
- `SrtExtractor/Models/SubtitleTrack.cs`
- `SrtExtractor/Views/MainWindow.xaml` (Lines 622-727)
- `SrtExtractor/Converters/` (create new converter if needed)

#### Visual Mockup
```
[Track List]
Language | Format              | Type    | Recommended | Name
---------|---------------------|---------|-------------|-----
English  | ‚ö° Text (fast)      | Full    | ‚≠ê         | English Subtitles
English  | üê¢ Image (OCR)     | Forced  |            | Forced Subs
Spanish  | ‚ö° Text (fast)      | Full    |            | Spanish
```

### 1.4 Reduce Log Visibility ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Effort:** LOW (4 hours)  
**Impact:** Reclaims 200px of vertical space, reduces visual noise
**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED via Tab Interface - October 10, 2025**

#### Problem
Log TextBox takes 150-200px of screen space and shows every log message. Most users never read it, but it's always visible.

#### Solution: Tab-Based Separation
Log is now completely removed from Extract and Batch tabs, available only in dedicated History tab.

#### Tasks
- [x] **Remove log from Extract/Batch tabs** (30 min) ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
  - Log display only exists in History tab
  - Extract and Batch tabs are clean and focused

- [x] **Status indication in each tab** (already done) ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
  - Processing indicators integrated into Extract/Batch tabs
  - No need for separate status bar - processing status shows contextually
  - Toast notifications handle important messages

- [x] **Log toolbar in History tab** (already done) ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
  - Clear log button
  - Save log button
  - Open log folder button
  - Full context menu with all options

- [x] **Smart notifications** (already implemented) ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
  - Toast notifications for errors/warnings
  - Processing messages shown contextually
  - Log contains detailed technical info for power users

#### Files to Modify
- `SrtExtractor/Views/MainWindow.xaml` (Lines 732-799)
- `SrtExtractor/State/ExtractionState.cs` (Add log filtering)
- Create new `StatusBar.xaml` control
- Update `MainViewModel.cs` to use status bar

#### Implementation Notes
```xaml
<!-- Status Bar at bottom of MainWindow -->
<Border Background="{StaticResource BackgroundAltBrush}" 
        Height="32" 
        DockPanel.Dock="Bottom">
  <Grid>
    <StackPanel Orientation="Horizontal" Margin="10,0">
      <TextBlock FontFamily="{StaticResource IconFontFamily}" 
                 Text="{Binding LastStatusIcon}"/>
      <TextBlock Text="{Binding LastStatusMessage}" 
                 Margin="8,0"/>
    </StackPanel>
    <Button Content="View Full Log" 
            Command="{Binding ShowHistoryTabCommand}"
            HorizontalAlignment="Right"/>
  </Grid>

## üìä Success Metrics & Testing

### User Testing Scenarios
After implementing Phase 1, test with 5 users (mix of technical and non-technical):

1. **First-time extraction** (success = completed in < 60 seconds)
   - Give user an MKV file
   - Ask them to extract English subtitles
   - Don't provide instructions
   - Measure: Time to completion, errors made, satisfaction (1-10)

2. **Batch processing** (success = 80% understand without help)
   - Give 3 video files
   - Ask them to extract subtitles from all
   - Measure: Do they find batch mode? Time to completion?

3. **Track selection** (success = choose correct track without help)
   - Give file with 3 subtitle tracks (PGS, SRT, Forced)
   - Ask for "English subtitles that won't require slow processing"
   - Measure: Do they select SRT track? Understand speed difference?

### Analytics to Track
- Time from launch to first extraction
- Percentage of users who try batch mode
- Error rate (failed extractions)
- Support ticket volume (before/after)
- User ratings in Microsoft Store

## üéØ Design Philosophy

All improvements should follow these principles:

1. **Progressive Disclosure**: Show simple UI first, reveal complexity as needed
2. **Don't Make Me Think**: Primary actions should be obvious
3. **Provide Feedback**: Always show what's happening and what will happen
4. **Forgiveness**: Allow easy undo/cancel, prevent errors
5. **Consistency**: Same patterns throughout the app

## üìö Resources & References

### Design Inspiration
- **Windows 11 Settings App**: Clean, tabbed interface
- **HandBrake**: Queue-based batch processing
- **VLC Media Player**: Track selection UI
- **Visual Studio Code**: Status bar implementation

### WCAG Guidelines
- [WCAG 2.1 Level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/)
- [Windows Accessibility](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/accessibility/accessibility)

## üìù Notes & Decisions

### Decisions Made
1. **Separate tabs instead of dual-mode**: Clearer mental model, less complexity
2. **Remove technical jargon**: Focus on user goals, not implementation details
3. **Default to simple**: Power users can enable advanced features
4. **Log in separate tab**: Most users never need detailed logs

### Open Questions
1. Should we add a "Simple Mode" toggle that hides advanced features entirely?
2. Do we need video thumbnails in batch queue, or is that overkill?
3. Should History tab show extraction results or just recent files?
4. Do we add analytics/telemetry to understand actual usage patterns?

### Future Considerations (Post v2.0)
- Cloud sync for settings across devices
- Preset profiles (e.g., "Movies", "TV Shows", "Anime")
- Integration with Plex/Jellyfin for automatic subtitle extraction
- Command-line interface for automation
- Multi-language UI (internationalization)
