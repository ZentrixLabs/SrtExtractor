00:09:02,411 --> 00:09:04,152
Or "hydrocolonic".

185
00:09:04,152 --> 00:09:06,894
Right, but that's
for a different reason, man.

186
00:09:06,894 --> 00:09:10,114
But he'd like you
to solve a mystery.

187
00:09:10,114 --> 00:09:12,769
He'll pay you a fee of $10,000.

188
00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:14,292
It's just,

189
00:09:14,292 --> 00:09:16,599
materialism's
not really our bag, man.

190
00:09:16,599 --> 00:09:17,818
Free airfare.

191
00:09:17,818 --> 00:09:18,906
No, thanks.

192
00:09:18,906 --> 00:09:20,342
Room and board.
No, thanks.

193
00:09:20,342 --> 00:09:22,387
And all you can eat.

194
00:09:25,216 --> 00:09:26,914
All you can eat?

195
00:09:42,146 --> 00:09:43,191
Fred?

196
00:09:43,191 --> 00:09:44,235
Velma?

197
00:09:44,235 --> 00:09:48,022
Are you going this way?

198
00:09:48,022 --> 00:09:48,979
Mm-hmm.

199
00:09:52,461 --> 00:09:53,462
How have you...

200
00:09:53,462 --> 00:09:54,550
Been?

201
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,160
Yes.

202
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,597
Great. Great.

203
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,946
I'm on
the lecture circuit

204
00:09:58,946 --> 00:10:00,469
with my new book...

205
00:10:00,469 --> 00:10:03,603
Fred on Fred:

The Many Faces of Me.

206
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,474
Jinkies, that's impressive.

207
00:10:05,474 --> 00:10:07,824
And yourself?

208
00:10:07,824 --> 00:10:10,000
I've been working at NASA,

209
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,915
developing hydropowered
missile defense systems.

210
00:10:11,915 --> 00:10:14,004
But, more importantly,

211
00:10:14,004 --> 00:10:16,093
I'm on a journey
of self-discovery.

212
00:10:16,093 --> 00:10:18,095
NASA?

213
00:10:18,095 --> 00:10:19,488
ANNOUNCER:
Charter service

to Spooky Island

214
00:10:19,488 --> 00:10:21,229
will begin boarding

momentarily.

215
00:10:21,229 --> 00:10:23,013
What do you mean

216
00:10:23,013 --> 00:10:24,362
I can't have
seven carry-on bags?

217
00:10:24,362 --> 00:10:25,407
That's so economy.

218
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,408
Crap.Crap.

219
00:10:28,497 --> 00:10:30,064
Oh, no.

220
00:10:30,064 --> 00:10:32,806
I'm not talking to you guys.

221
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:38,899
What are you doing here?

222
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:40,204
Isn't it obvious?

223
00:10:40,204 --> 00:10:41,989
We all received
the same letter

224
00:10:41,989 --> 00:10:43,555
from one Emile Mondavarious,

225
00:10:43,555 --> 00:10:45,645
the reclusive owner
of Spooky Island.

226
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,603
It's not fair.

227
00:10:47,603 --> 00:10:50,171
I was going to
solve the mystery all by myself.

228
00:10:50,171 --> 00:10:51,476
And when you get caught?

229
00:10:51,476 --> 00:10:53,130
I'm a black belt now.

230
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:56,612
I've transformed my body
into a dangerous weapon.

231
00:10:58,832 --> 00:10:59,963
It's true.

232
00:10:59,963 --> 00:11:02,183
Far out.

233
00:11:02,183 --> 00:11:04,533
I guess we're, like,
all going to Spooky Island, man.

234
00:11:04,533 --> 00:11:06,187
Where's Scooby?

235
00:11:13,585 --> 00:11:14,935
Hello.

236
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:19,983
They don't allow big dogs
on the plane.

237
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,120
You've got to be kidding.

238
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,470
No one is stupid enough
to believe that.

239
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,690
Who's the ugly old broad?

240
00:11:33,388 --> 00:11:35,738
Say hello to Grandma.

241
00:11:35,738 --> 00:11:37,218
SCOOBY-DOO: Aloha.

242
00:11:37,218 --> 00:11:39,481
Flight 3774 to Spooky Island
now boarding.

243
00:11:39,481 --> 00:11:41,701
I wouldn't have agreed to come
if I knew.

244
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:45,008
Wait, just think about it
for one minute.

245
00:11:45,008 --> 00:11:46,618
Mystery Inc. reunites.

246
00:11:46,618 --> 00:11:49,709
We'll be a team again,
just like the old days,

247
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,667
so come on, gang,

248
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:53,974
let's do that thing
where we all put our hands in,

249
00:11:53,974 --> 00:11:56,628
we lift them up,
and we go "Whoo-hoo-hoo!"

250
00:11:56,628 --> 00:11:59,414
Only if Fred and Velma do it.

251
00:12:02,983 --> 00:12:05,028
People are watching, Shag.

252
00:12:13,428 --> 00:12:15,386
Roo-hoo.

253
00:12:15,386 --> 00:12:17,475
Yeah, Scoob, "Roo-hoo."

254
00:12:17,475 --> 00:12:18,955
Come on, buddy.

255
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,413
Now, that is
a beautiful work of art.

256
00:12:42,413 --> 00:12:44,502
Ra-ha.

257
00:13:00,954 --> 00:13:04,479
Would you mind me
taking a seat there next to...

258
00:13:04,479 --> 00:13:06,437
To my grandma.
That's my grandma.

259
00:13:06,437 --> 00:13:07,961
Hi, Grandma.

260
00:13:07,961 --> 00:13:09,092
Like, no.

261
00:13:12,313 --> 00:13:13,444
Thanks.

262
00:13:13,444 --> 00:13:14,924
You're welcome.

263
00:13:16,621 --> 00:13:18,101
Bless you.

264
00:13:18,101 --> 00:13:21,975
I'm sorry. My allergies.

265
00:13:21,975 --> 00:13:23,933
It's usually only dogs
that do it.

266
00:13:27,763 --> 00:13:29,634
Maybe I'd better move.

267
00:13:29,634 --> 00:13:30,766
No, wait.

268
00:13:32,072 --> 00:13:34,770
It's probably
just my grandma's perfume.

269
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:38,078
Yeah, even I sometimes get
a little allergic, you know.

270
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:40,167
Oh, jeez.

271
00:13:40,167 --> 00:13:42,952
'Cause I'm pretty sure

272
00:13:42,952 --> 00:13:44,998
Grandma wants to go back
and visit with her pal Velma.

273
00:13:44,998 --> 00:13:47,609
Right, Grandma?

274
00:13:47,609 --> 00:13:49,480
Okay.

275
00:13:54,877 --> 00:13:57,532
Boy, oh, boy,

276
00:13:57,532 --> 00:13:58,794
those sure do look
like Scooby Snacks.

277
00:13:58,794 --> 00:14:01,231
I know they're for dogs,

278
00:14:01,231 --> 00:14:04,539
but they're 100% vegetarian,
and I love them.

279
00:14:04,539 --> 00:14:05,932
Like, me too.

280
00:14:05,932 --> 00:14:07,672
Far out.

281
00:14:07,672 --> 00:14:09,936
I've never met another person
who loves Scooby Snacks.

282
00:14:09,936 --> 00:14:10,937
Me neither.

283
00:14:10,937 --> 00:14:12,329
I'm Mary Jane.

284
00:14:12,329 --> 00:14:14,375
Like, that's my favorite name.

285
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:15,419
Really?

286
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:16,464
Yeah.

287
00:14:16,464 --> 00:14:17,465
No way.

288
00:14:23,819 --> 00:14:24,864
Hello.

289
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,268
Grandma?

290
00:14:38,268 --> 00:14:40,488
Velma, it's simple
behavior modification.

291
00:14:40,488 --> 00:14:41,619
To cause a dog

292
00:14:41,619 --> 00:14:43,273
to discontinue
any action,

293
00:14:43,273 --> 00:14:44,971
flick it on the nose.

294
00:14:44,971 --> 00:14:46,363
Observe.

295
00:14:46,363 --> 00:14:47,930
Scoob?

296
00:14:49,976 --> 00:14:51,455
See?

297
00:14:56,765 --> 00:14:59,159
SHAGGY:
Sit, Grandma! Bad Grandma!

298
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:01,901
Don't eat the kitty!

299
00:15:08,255 --> 00:15:10,866
ANNOUNCER:

Welcome to Spooky Island...

300
00:15:10,866 --> 00:15:12,694
the frightfully popular

301
00:15:12,694 --> 00:15:16,045
spring break spot

for college students.

302
00:15:16,045 --> 00:15:18,395
Catch our

Electrical Torture Parade,

303
00:15:18,395 --> 00:15:20,397
"It's a Dead World After All"

304
00:15:20,397 --> 00:15:24,401
and the world-famous

"Splatterhorn".

305
00:15:24,401 --> 00:15:27,491
Scooby-Doo!

306
00:15:27,491 --> 00:15:29,276
And the rest of Mystery Inc.

307
00:15:29,276 --> 00:15:30,842
It's marvelous to see you!

308
00:15:30,842 --> 00:15:32,540
How fanta--

309
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,542
That's the second time

this week.

310
00:15:35,978 --> 00:15:37,153
Thank goodness.

311
00:15:37,153 --> 00:15:39,547
Sorry, it's a new toy.

312
00:15:39,547 --> 00:15:41,810
I'm just getting up to speed
with it.

313
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,551
Welcome.

314
00:15:43,551 --> 00:15:44,682
Thank goodness.

315
00:15:44,682 --> 00:15:46,510
I was afraid
I'd have to lug those

316
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,903
all the way to the hotel.

317
00:15:47,903 --> 00:15:50,036
That's what
Spooky Island's about,

318
00:15:50,036 --> 00:15:52,299
realizing your worst fears.

319
00:15:52,299 --> 00:15:54,083
I'm Emile Mondavarious,

320
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:57,434
the owner
of this amusement park.

321
00:15:57,434 --> 00:15:59,088
VELMA:
You seem less...

322
00:15:59,088 --> 00:16:00,350
Spooky.

323
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,699
Than we'd have guessed.

324
00:16:01,699 --> 00:16:04,876
I can be pretty spooky
when called upon.

325
00:16:04,876 --> 00:16:05,877
I can go...

326
00:16:05,877 --> 00:16:08,663
"Rrrowr, rrowr!"

327
00:16:08,663 --> 00:16:11,753
Claws and everything.

328
00:16:11,753 --> 00:16:14,364
You wouldn't want to run into me
in a dark alley.

329
00:16:14,364 --> 00:16:16,714
So you're the one
who brought us here?

330
00:16:16,714 --> 00:16:18,586
No.

331
00:16:18,586 --> 00:16:22,068
What brought you here
was your insatiable appetite

332
00:16:22,068 --> 00:16:23,591
for a juicy mystery.

333
00:16:23,591 --> 00:16:28,161
The truth is,
Mystery Inc. is broken up.

334
00:16:28,161 --> 00:16:30,598
That's the beauty
of broken things.

335
00:16:30,598 --> 00:16:31,903
It can be fixed.

336
00:16:31,903 --> 00:16:34,036
Therein lies
its potential.

337
00:16:34,036 --> 00:16:36,386
And I need you
to fix Spooky Island.

338
00:16:36,386 --> 00:16:37,953
VELMA: What's the problem?

339
00:16:37,953 --> 00:16:39,476
EMILE: I believe

340
00:16:39,476 --> 00:16:41,652
somebody's casting a spell
on the students.

341
00:16:41,652 --> 00:16:44,307
Now, listen and look around.

342
00:16:44,307 --> 00:16:46,614
Notice any difference

343
00:16:46,614 --> 00:16:49,095
between those arriving
and those departing?

344
00:16:49,095 --> 00:16:53,012
DAPHNE:They look like sober,
well-behaved college kids.

345
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,057
EMILE: Precisely.
They didn't before they came.

346
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:56,798
They've changed.

347
00:16:56,798 --> 00:17:00,323
In other words, a magic spell.

348
00:17:00,323 --> 00:17:02,456
Carol!
Carol, how was the island?

349
00:17:02,456 --> 00:17:04,762
Are you tricking on me?

350
00:17:06,808 --> 00:17:09,419
It's me, Brad.

351
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:11,334
We've known each other
since we were 3.

352
00:17:11,334 --> 00:17:13,075
Back off my grill, son!

353
00:17:13,075 --> 00:17:15,469
Carol,
what are you doing?

354
00:17:26,871 --> 00:17:28,569
I'm terrified.

355
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:31,311
The young people
that come off that barge,

356
00:17:31,311 --> 00:17:33,965
the people I love the most,

357
00:17:33,965 --> 00:17:35,750
they're in danger.

358
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,057
I'm going
to solve this one first.

359
00:17:39,101 --> 00:17:40,233
Not before I solve it first.

360
00:17:40,233 --> 00:17:42,539
You'll look like total idiots

361
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:44,889
when you're captured
and I save you.

362
00:17:44,889 --> 00:17:47,936
Thank you. Marvelous.

363
00:17:47,936 --> 00:17:49,503
Maybe we can celebrate later

364
00:17:49,503 --> 00:17:50,591
by having
a little spookapalooza.

365
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:54,464
