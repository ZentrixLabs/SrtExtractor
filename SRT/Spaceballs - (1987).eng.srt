Yes! And I'm glad.

180
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,654
Glad.

I wonder
if she's glad.

Don't be ridiculous.

183

As president
of Planet Spaceball,

00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,839
I can assure
both you and your viewers

185
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:03,634
that there's
absolutely no air shortage
whatsoever.

186
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:07,055
Yes, of course.
I've heard
the same rumor myself.

187
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:10,141
Yes, thanks for calling
and not reversing the charges.

188
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,476
Yes, bye.

189
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,811

speaking, Sir.

Yes, what is it,
Commanderette?

197
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:42,673
Lord Helmet has just
notified us that
Princess Vespa is in sight

and Spaceball One
is closing in on her.

Good.

200
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:50,264
We have both ships coming up
on the teledar, sir,
if you wish to observe.

201
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:51,724
I'll be down immediately.

202
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:54,519
Should I have Snotty
beam you down, sir?

203
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,814
I don't know about
that beaming stuff.
Is it safe?

204
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:01,150
Oh, yes, sir.
Snotty beamed me
twice last night.

205
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:03,444
It was wonderful.

206
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,905
All right.
I'll take a shot at it.

This is terrible!
Do something!

215
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:42,024
I'm sorry, sir.
There must have been
a micro-converter malfunction.

my ass was so big?

The radar, sir.

353
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:13,624
It appears to be

354
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,626

355
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:18,420
Jammed.

356
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:23,717
Raspberry.

357
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:30,140
Well, there's only one man
who would dare
give me the raspberry.

358
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:33,269
Lone Starr!

360
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:02,047

362
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,217

364
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:08,345
Hi.

365
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,514
Who are you?
Barf.

366
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:13,475
Not in here, mister.
This is a Mercedes.

367
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,728
No, that's
my name. Barf.

368
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:16,896
Barf?

369
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:18,314
What are you?

370
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:20,858
I'm a Mawag:
half man, half dog.

371
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:23,193
I'm my own best friend.

372
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:24,570
What do you want?

373
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:27,072
Your father hired
Captain Lone Starr
and me to save you.

374
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:29,033
We got to hop up
this ladder and get out.

375
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:31,243
Good. Quick.
Hurry, darling.
Follow the dog.

376
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:32,828
Mawg. I'm a Mawg.

377
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,664
Wait. What about
my matched luggage?

What the hell
is all that?

382
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:02,232
It's Her Royal Highness's

00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:03,359
LONE STARR: What?

384
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:06,570
Her Royal Highness's
matched luggage.

385
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:08,948
Matched luggage, huh?

386
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:11,617
What's she think this is,
a Princess Cruise?

387
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,994
Well, she wouldn't
go without it.

388
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:15,371
Oh, yeah?

390
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,584
Now hear this.

391
00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:23,462
The minute
we get out of here,
the first thing we do is

392
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:25,547
dump the matched luggage.

393
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:27,716
Who is that?

394
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,595
Now you hear this,
whoever you are.

395
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:34,348
You will not touch
that luggage.

396
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:37,309
And furthermore,
I want this pigsty
cleaned up.

397
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:40,020
I will not be rescued
in such filth.

398
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:44,358
Listen. On this ship,
I don't take orders,
I give them.

399
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:46,860
This is my dreamboat,
sweetheart.

400
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,529
Sweetheart?

401
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:49,780
Oh-oh.

402
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:53,158
How dare you
speak to me that way?

403
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:56,578
You will address me
in the proper manner
as Your Royal Highness.

404
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:58,539
I am Princess Vespa,

405
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:01,959
daughter of Roland,
King of the Druids.

406
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,463
That's all we needed.

407
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:09,216
A Druish princess.

408
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:14,138
Funny.
She doesn't look Druish.

409
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:54,303
Now we will show her
who is in charge
of this galaxy.

410
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:59,099
Hold it.
I'll handle this
personally.

411
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:02,352
Jawohl,
Lord Helmet!

412
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:08,067
So, Princess Vespa,

413
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:11,987
you thought you could
outwit the imperious forces
of Planet Spaceball.

414
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:14,031
Well, you were wrong.

415
00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:16,283
You are now our prisoner.

416
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:19,286
And you will be held
hostage until such time

417
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:22,873
as all of the air
IS transferred
from your planet

418
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:24,917

419
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:35,094

CORPORAL ON PA:
Radar repaired, sir.

421
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:40,933
We're picking up the outline
of a Winnebago.

422
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,935
Winnebago?

423
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:44,978
Lone Starr.

424
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:56,031
Here comes
the Badyear blimp.

425
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,408
We'd better get out
of here in a hurry.

426
00:26:58,492 --> 00:27:00,202
Switch to
secret hyper-jets.

427
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,037
Switching to
secret hyper-jets.

428
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:05,541
Buckle up back there,
we're going
into hyperactive.

429
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:14,508
We're closing in
on them, sir.

430
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:16,885
In less than a minute,
Lone Starr will be ours.

431
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:19,638
Good.
Prepare to attack.

432
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,056
Prepare to attack.

433
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,100

00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:29,731
What happened?
Where are they?

438
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:31,024
I don't know, sir.

439
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:32,693
They must have
hyper-jets
on that thing.

440
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:34,903
And what have
we got on this thing,
a Cuisinart?

441
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:35,988
No, sir.

442

Well, find them,

ON PA: Prepare ship
for light speed.

445
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,660
No, light speed
is too slow.

Yes! Your father was a king.
Your mother was a queen.

We're so bad and mean

1571
01:35:49,744 --> 01:35:52,622
We make nightmares
out of dreams

1572
01:35:53,539 --> 01:35:56,668
We're the Spaceballs

1573
01:35:57,293 --> 01:36:00,088
We're the Spaceballs

1574
01:36:01,547 --> 01:36:02,590
You better

1575
01:36:02,674 --> 01:36:03,841
Waitch out!

1576
01:36:03,925 --> 01:36:05,426
(MAN LAUGHING)
